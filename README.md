# Diaper Wizard

***Diaper Wizard*** is a tool for parents and expecting parents to plan the number of diapers needed for a certain period of their child's life. Babies use a different amount of diapers every day during the first days of life. After the first week the number stabilizes and we can estimate it based on age, and weight. This tool can make your life a bit easier when you need to plan ahead. We are using average values based on research. Just enter the birth date of your child, or another starting date, and choose a final date to calculate the amount of diapers you'll need for this period!
