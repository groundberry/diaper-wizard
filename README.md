# Diaper Wizard

***Diaper Wizard*** is a tool for parents and expecting parents to plan the number of diapers needed for a certain period of their child's life. Babies use a different amount of diapers every day during the first days of life. This tool can make your life a bit easier. Just enter the birth date of your child, or another starting date, and choose a date to calculate the amount of diapers you'll need for this period!
